    "Add additional predictors that are the original predictors raised to a power, ie X, X^2, X^3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Functions\n",
    "Cut the range of a variable into K distinct regions to produce a qualitative variable.  Fits like a piecewise constant function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Splines\n",
    "Similar to Step Function & Poly Regression, divide range of X into distinct regions and fit each region using a polynomial function.  But, they are constrained so they join smoothly to each region boundary (aka knot)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smoothing Splines\n",
    "Similar to regression splines, but result from minimizing RSS with a smoothness penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Regression\n",
    "Similar to splines, but regions can overlap, in a smooth way\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalized Additive Model\n",
    "Extend above methods to work with multiple predictors\n",
