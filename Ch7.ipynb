    "Similar to Step Function & Poly Regression, divide range of X into distinct regions and fit each region using a polynomial function.  But, they are constrained so they join smoothly to each region boundary (aka knot)\n",

    "### Smoothing Splines\n",
    "Similar to regression splines, but result from minimizing RSS with a smoothness penalty.\n",

    "Similar to splines, but regions can overlap, in a smooth way\n",
